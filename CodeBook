Code book „TidySet.txt“

The data used represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Following steps have been done to create the Data „TidySet.txt“
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6.	Save data in file „TidySet.txt“
The code is written in the file „run_Analysis.R“

Variables in „TidySet.txt“:
1.	activityId: 
Integer Number to identify the activity:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
2.	subjectId:  
Integer Number 1 to 30: 
Number to identify the group of participating persons

3.	Variables 3-181:  Averages of Mean and standard deviation variables,  normalized to -1 to 1
